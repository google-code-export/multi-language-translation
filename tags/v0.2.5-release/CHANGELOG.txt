This file contains details of all changes and enhancements made to the Multi-Language Translation Script 
since its release...


LEGEND:


NEW: A new functionality or capability offered by the script.
IMP: An improvement or enhancement to existing functionality.
FIX: A bugfix - corrects any problems or undesired behaviours in the script.


CHANGES MADE:


[v0.2.5 - 2010-01-22]
FIX:	 Fixed bug that could cause script errors and crashes on certain sites. NOTE: as part of this 
	 fix, the configurable variables GL_classIds and GL_classNames can no longer contain commas
	 after the last specified regions - if upgrading, this may need to be fixed manually.


[v0.2.4 - 2010-01-18]
NEW:	 When a new user visits a site, by default the script will now auto-detect their language, based 
	 on their browser or system settings. A message will be shown at the top, asking if they wish to 
	 translate the page into that language. If they click 'Yes' all pages will be translated into that
	 language automatically in future; if they click 'No' they can still change languages manually, 
	 but will no longer be prompted.
NEW:	 Alternatively, the webmaster can now specify an initial site language; when new users visit each 
	 page will automatically be translated into that language. It is still possible to specify that 
	 pages should be displayed in their original languages (without displaying a prompt message), 
	 if desired.
IMP:	 The class names / ids of all interface components added by the script are now all prepended with
	 "mlt_". This reduces the likelihood of conflicts with existing elements on a page. NOTE: This
	 includes the "languagelist" element, so if upgrading from a previous version, you need to rename 
	 your previously inserted HTML snippet to the following: <div id="mlt_languagelist"></div> 
IMP:	 Refactored some code that displays a formatted language name - allowing for easier re-use.
FIX:	 Minor fix - script will now check that page content can actually be translated into a requested
	 language before submitting to google - thus avoiding translation errors in these rare cases.
 

[v0.2.3 - 2009-11-29]
IMP:	 All auto-translations of interface components since the page last loaded are now also stored, so
	 they can be displayed virtually instantaneously if required later. Works until the user revisits
	 or reloads the page, or navigates to another page.


[v0.2.2 - 2009-11-29]
IMP:	 The script now stores all translations completed since the page was last loaded. If the user
	 switches to any one of these languages, the translated content will now therefore be displayed
	 virtually instantaneously. Note that this will only work until the user revisits/reloads the 
	 page, or navigates elsewhere on the site. After this, all content will have to be re-translated 
	 from scratch again. The enhancement is nevertheless helpful to users who regularly switch 
	 languages whilst on a page.
NEW:	 When the mouse is moved over interface components that have been auto-translated into the current 
	 site language, a tooltip will now appear, displaying their original English source text.


[v0.2.1 - 2009-11-15]
NEW:	 Users are now able to optionally view the Source text of translated regions (as specified by the
	 webmaster). Integrated with the existing feature allowing the the webmaster to optionally display 
	 the source language of various regions. Now an additional link will appear next to this text line; 
	 if clicked, the source text will be displayed (and highlighted in a green font) below the translated 
	 text. If the link is clicked again, the source text will then be hidden. The functionality is also 
	 fully integrated with the error handling functionality - now the source text of affected sections 
	 can be revealed by clicking on the relevant link on page (rather than being displayed by default, 
	 as introduced in version 0.2.0).
FIX:	 The listbox displaying all languages is no longer re-created repeatedly during translation (caused 
	 by a flaw in a workaround preventing the language list from disappearing completely if located in 
	 a region being translated). Now the listbox will just be created as the page loads, refreshed once 
	 (but not completely recreated) if required during translation, and finally re-created once after 
	 translation [in case any problems occurred earlier].
FIX:	 During translation, the content of a region will only now be replaced by translated text if it has
	 not already been replaced. Partially related to the previous bugfix.
IMP:	 Refactored some code from the checkTransStatus() and endTranslation() functions to reduce 
	 duplication and ease future maintenance.


[v0.2.0 - 2009-11-02]
NEW: 	 Initial Open Source release. Substantial re-working of many script portions:
NEW/IMP: The script can now be deployed easily on any website. Regions to translate on each page can be 
	 indicated by the webmaster far more simply and flexibly. Because the source language can now
	 easily be specified for regions with known languages, the likelihood of translation errors is
	 reduced.
NEW/IMP: Script now creates a local 'cache' every time each page loads, 'chunking' the content as part of 
	 this process. This means that all content can be submitted to Google immediately, and correctly
	 reassembled after translation - rather than having to wait for translation of each region to
	 complete. This results in noticeably faster and smoother translations in most cases. It also
	 means that translations can be performed on page 'dynamically', without reloading the page.
IMP:	 More reliable and far more efficient language detection. To increase translation speed, creation
	 of the text line displaying the source language is now performed entirely after translation.
IMP:	 Webmaster can now easily specify multiple regions to show text line revealing source language.
NEW/IMP: Dramatically improved error handling. User can now optionally view details of ALL errors that
	 may have occurred (rather than just the most recent one), as well as see the sections affected
	 (displayed as HTML code to aid debugging by webmasters). The affected sections are still also
	 marked on the page itself; but are now highlighted in a red font, and the original Source text 
	 of affected sections is shown at the correct location on each page as well. The user also now
	 has the ability to dismiss any error messages that appear.
NEW:	 Script now handles 'timeouts' effectively - allowing users to retry a translation if not
	 complete after 30 seconds.
NEW:	 The listbox containing all languages is now generated dynamically when the page loads, and
	 contains the complete list of languages available from Google. Each language is automatically
	 translated so that native speakers can find their language more easily.
FIX/IMP: Numerous other reliability improvements and minor bugfixes.
	 

[v0.1.0 - MAY/JUNE 2009]
